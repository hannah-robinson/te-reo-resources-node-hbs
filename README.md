# Te Reo Resources – a Nodejs app

A collection of resources for learning and practising te reo Māori, built using Node.js, Express and HandleBars. Includes Jest unit tests. I have since rebuilt this app with React, Node.js, Express and SQLite. The new repo is [here](https://github.com/hannah-robinson/te-reo-resources-node-react).
